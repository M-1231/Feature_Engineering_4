    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical format, but they are applied under different circumstances and have distinct characteristics:\n",

    "Use Case                                               Appropriate when there's a meaningful order or hierarchy among categorical categories.                                                                     Suitable when there's no inherent order or hierarchy among categorical categories. Typically used for binary or nominal variables.\n",
    "Encoding Method                                        Assigns integer labels based on the order or rank of categories. Lower integers represent lower ranks, higher integers represent higher ranks.             Assigns unique integer labels to each category without considering order or ranking. Each category is treated as a separate entity.\n",

    "Application                                            Typically used for variables with ordinal data, like education levels, satisfaction ratings, or temperature levels.                                        Useful for encoding nominal variables or binary categories, where there's no natural order.\n",

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables by considering the relationship between the category and the target variable in a supervised machine learning setting. It assigns ordinal values to categories based on the likelihood or probability of a particular category resulting in a specific target outcome. This technique is particularly useful when you have categorical features with a large number of categories and you want to capture the impact of each category on the target variable in a more meaningful way.\n",
    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "1.Calculate Target Statistics: For each unique category within the categorical feature, calculate summary statistics based on the target variable. Common statistics include the mean, median, or mode of the target variable for each category.\n",
    "2.Order Categories: Sort the categories based on their calculated statistics. Categories with higher mean (or other chosen statistics) of the target variable will be assigned higher values, indicating a stronger relationship with the target.\n",
    "3.Encode Categories: Replace the original categorical values with the ordered numeric values based on their calculated statistics. The resulting ordinal values can then be used as features in your machine learning model.\n",
    "4.Handle Missing Values: If a category is missing from the test dataset but present in the training dataset, you can handle it by assigning a default value or using a suitable imputation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of when you might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "Scenario: Predicting Customer Churn in a Telecom Company\n",
    "In a machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn in a telecom company, you have a categorical feature called \"Contract Type\" that represents the type of contract each customer has. The possible values for this feature are \"Month-to-Month,\" \"One Year,\" and \"Two Year.\"\n",
    "You know that the contract type is likely to have a significant impact on customer churn, and there's a meaningful hierarchy: \"Two Year\" contracts are likely to have a lower churn rate than \"One Year\" contracts, which, in turn, are likely to have a lower churn rate than \"Month-to-Month\" contracts.\n",
    "To leverage this ordinal relationship between contract types and churn rates, you can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:"

    "Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree to which two random variables change together. In other words, it measures the joint variability of two variables. Specifically, covariance indicates whether an increase in one variable corresponds to an increase, decrease, or no change in another variable.\n",
    "Here's a simplified explanation of covariance:\n",
    "*If the covariance between two variables is positive, it means that when one variable tends to be above its mean, the other variable also tends to be above its mean. In other words, they move in the same direction.\n",
    "*If the covariance is negative, it indicates that when one variable tends to be above its mean, the other variable tends to be below its mean. They move in opposite directions.\n",
    "*If the covariance is close to zero or has a small magnitude, it suggests that there is little to no linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "Covariance is an important concept in statistical analysis as:\n",
    "1.Relationship Assessment: Covariance helps assess whether there is a linear relationship between two variables. It provides an initial indication of whether changes in one variable might be associated with changes in another.\n",
    "2.Portfolio Diversification: In finance, covariance is used to assess the diversification benefits of adding different assets to an investment portfolio. Negative covariances between assets can reduce overall portfolio risk.\n",
    "3.Machine Learning: Covariance can be used in machine learning algorithms, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and linear regression, to understand and model relationships between features or variables.\n",
    "4.Multivariate Analysis: In multivariate statistics, covariance matrices are used to analyze the relationships between multiple variables simultaneously. This is important in fields like economics, social sciences, and biology.\n",
    "The formula to calculate the covariance between two variables X and Y based on a sample is as follows:\n",
